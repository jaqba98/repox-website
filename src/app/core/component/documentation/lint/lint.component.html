      The repox lint project command is powered by eslint, allowing linting across all projects within your
      monorepository. This command serves as a dynamic and adaptable solution for updating and modifying existing
      elements, ensuring a development environment that evolves with your requirements. It provides a straightforward
      method to regenerate workspaces and projects in response to changing needs.
