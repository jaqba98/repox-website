>>> Introduction <<<
I am creating a documentation of my own software named "Repox".
That software is responsible for managing monorepo project.
Monorepo project is a specific type of project which contains many projects inside one git repository.
My software is similar to NX (www.nx.dev).

>>> Question <<<
Could you create a short documentation section about generate command in general? Only theory without practice.
Max 3 paragraphs. b1 english!
