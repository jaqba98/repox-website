>>> Introduction <<<
I am creating a documentation of my own software named "Repox".
That software is responsible for managing monorepo project.
Monorepo project is a specific type of project which contains many projects inside one git repository.
My software is similar to NX (www.nx.dev).
I am creating documentation section for "generate workspace" command.


>>> Dictionary <<<
"generate" is a program, we can use "g" alias instead of "generate"
"workspace" is a command, we can use "w" alias instead of "workspace", it must not exist without generate program

>>> Program arguments <<<
lack

>>> Command arguments <<<
* --name (argument) or -n (alias)
  Description: That argument defines name of the workspace. It is a folder name which will be created on the disk.
  Required: true
  Value: string

>>> Argument syntax with value <<<
--${argument-name}=${value} <-- for arguments
-${alias-name}=${value} <-- for aliases

>>> Section structure <<<
1) Title
2) Description
3) Syntax
4) Arguments
5) Example
6) Note

>>> Question <<<
Could you create such a documentation section?
