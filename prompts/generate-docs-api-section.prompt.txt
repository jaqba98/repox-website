Assumption:
>>>
I'm creating documentation for my own software called "Repox".
That software is responsible for managing monorepo project.
Monorepo project contains many projects inside one git repository.
My project is similar to nx.dev but it is my own implementation of it.

I'm creating documentation section for `generate workspace`.
`generate` is a program, we can use `g` alias instead of full program name
`workspace` is a command, we can use `w` alias instead of full command name

The command is a part of program.

Syntax:
repox [program] [...arguments] [command] [...arguments]
Example:
repox program --arg1=aaa command -b=test

Requirements:
- repox word is required
- argument with values required = sign between argument name and argument value
<<<

Program arguments: lack

Command arguments:
>>>
* --name (argument) or -n (alias)
  Description: That argument defines name of the workspace
  Required: true
  Value: string
<<<
