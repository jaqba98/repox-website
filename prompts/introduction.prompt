>>> Introduction <<<
I am creating a documentation of my own software named "Repox".
That software is responsible for managing monorepo project.
Monorepo project is a specific type of project which contains many projects inside one git repository.
My software is similar to NX (www.nx.dev).
I will ask you some questions!
